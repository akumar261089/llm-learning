Using advanced AI profiling (e.g., integration with a tool like Google Audience Insights or Facebook Ads Manager API), the system generates target audience suggestions dynamically if specific audience criteria haven’t been defined explicitly.

1. **Inputs for Profiling:**
   - Product details (e.g., clothing brand, tech gadget).
   - Campaign focus (e.g., sustainability, innovation).
   - Brand demographics (e.g., upscale, casual).
2. **Audience Segmentation Recommendations:**  
   The AI suggests:

Recommendations are displayed to the user for approval, along with audience explanations or predictive insights (e.g., “Men ages 25-35 in large cities are likely to engage with tech-focused sustainability posts”).

---

#### **Phase 4: Scheduling Posts**

The approved content and audience segments are stored in a queue to be automatically scheduled for posting across major platforms.

1. **Supported Platforms:** Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, etc.
