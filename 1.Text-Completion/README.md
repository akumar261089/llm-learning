# ‚úç Text Completion API with FastAPI

The **Text Completion API** enables you to generate coherent text completions using Azure OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLM). Whether you're writing stories, generating marketing copy, or assisting in creative tasks, this API is the perfect starting point to add AI-powered text generation to your workflows.

This project uses **FastAPI** as the backend framework and includes modular components for easy customization and scalability.

---

## üìö Overview

### What is Text Completion?

Text completion is a common use case of large language models where you provide a partial input (called a _prompt_), and the model generates the continuation of that input. This is ideal for applications like:

- Creative writing
- Brainstorming ideas
- Automated document drafting
- Generating responses for conversational agents

---

## üî• Features

- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Leverages Azure's GPT-based LLM for generating completions.
- **Highly Configurable**: Control `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `top_p` for fine-tuning output behavior.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Explore and test the API interactively via [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
- **Error Handling**: Robust error-handling mechanisms for invalid inputs and API issues.
- **Expandable**: Future-ready backend that can integrate with React-based UI or other components.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Azure OpenAI resource set up with an active deployment
- API Key and endpoint from Azure OpenAI Portal

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd 1.Text-Completion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```plaintext
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<deployment-name>
AZURE_API_VERSION=2023-07-01-preview
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-endpoint>`, `<deployment-name>`, and `<your-api-key>` with your actual Azure OpenAI settings.

### Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)** to explore the API using FastAPI‚Äôs interactive Swagger UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Usage

### Endpoint

`POST /text-completion`

### Request Body (JSON Format)

- **`prompt`** _(required)_: A list of messages forming the conversation (e.g., system instructions, user queries). Each message contains:
  - `role`: The role of the message (`"system"`, `"user"`, or `"assistant"`).
  - `content`: The text content of the message.
- **`max_tokens`** _(optional)_: Maximum length of the AI-generated response. Default is `100`.
- **`temperature`** _(optional)_: Controls the creativity of the output (`0.0` is deterministic, `1.0` is highly creative). Default is `0.7`.
- **`top_p`** _(optional)_: Controls the "nucleus sampling" strategy, where the model focuses on the most probable tokens. Default is `0.95`.

### Example CURL Command

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/text-completion" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "prompt": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for creative writing."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Once upon a time in a small village, there was a"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 50,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_p": 0.95
}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "completion": "young artist who dreamed of painting the most beautiful sunrise. Every day, they practiced endlessly, inspired by the rolling hills and golden rays that surrounded their village."
}
```

      "content": "Write a magical story about a dragon that protects a hidden treasure."
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```text
  Deep within the misty mountains, a mystical blue dragon guarded a treasure hidden for centuries. It was said that the treasure contained jewels capable of granting immortality.

## üõ† Challenges & Improvements

### Challenges

- Coherence: Ensuring completions remain consistent and contextually aligned with the prompt.
- Hallucinations: Avoiding outputs that inject irrelevant or factually incorrect information.

### Future Improvements

1. **React UI Integration**: Add a user-friendly frontend for seamless interaction.
2. **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the LLM for specific domains like marketing content or legal writing.
3. **Example Database**: Preload real-world examples for users to test and customize.
4. **Analytics**: Log and analyze completions for user feedback and optimization.
